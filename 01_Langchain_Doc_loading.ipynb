Well, for starters, I'll put it out there that one of the reasons for that is that I felt like it isn't worth being read by the world. That's probably one of the worst ways to convince you to read it until the end, but we're all about allowing ourselves to be human in this space. I'm 26 this year (August 2022), and I suddenly got the edge to release this collection because as I went through these notes one night, I realized that every thing I wrote was what I needed to hear from myself at different points of my life. So I thought — what if I'm not the only one? I couldn't be more honored now that you're here, reading this, three years later.\\n\\nI want you to know that you're not the only one in the process of learning how to have a healthy relationship with yourself. We're all trying to figure it out. You start by making an effort in the little things, like how you talk to and about yourself daily. This book is your start. But it will take more than just reading it to get to a point where you're in a good relationship with yourself. Self-love and awareness is a lifetime journey that needs you to be dedicated and very intentional. Be aware of your thought pattern. How does what you think about yourself impact you? Which words or phrases make you feel good about yourself? Which ones make you feel pity, sadness, anxiety, or hopeless ness? You've got to know the cause to treat it right.\\n\\nMany things work differently for everyone, but I hope the words in this book heal you and give you a fresh start. The good news is that we get countless chances to be good to ourselves. It doesn't matter how long you've had a toxic or dark relationship with yourself. What matters is that you take the step to fix, heal, and restore it.\\n\\nThank you for getting your hands on this book. I hope it makes the difference you anticipate and long for. More importantly, I wish you love, warmth and happiness.\\n\\nYours,\\n\\nNoeleen\\n\\n\\n\\nCOLLECTION I\\n\\nGrowth, love & healing\\n\\n(55)\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s to exploring,\\n\\nLearning, unlearning, Living and loving yourself more.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nBreathe.\\n\\nOne day at a time.\\n\\nOne step at a time.\\n\\nYou’re doing a lot better than you think.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't get better, or perhaps it does.\\n\\nBut ultimately, you get better.\\n\\nYou grow,\\n\\nYou change, you evolve.\\n\\nAnd maybe that's the point.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nRegardless of the painful parts of your past You still love as if it's the only thing you know.\\n\\nThat's your strength.\\n\\nI hope you try to embrace your power.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nBeing imperfect doesn't make you any less worthy of love, progression, happiness, or everything beautiful about this world.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nYour experiences are there to show you different layers of yourself. They're not there to expose your weaknesses. Whenever you go through the trials life throws at you, you learn how to best respond. When you discover your unpleasant way of dealing with things, learn how to soar through those circumstances with gentleness and warmth.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nHey,\\n\\nAt this moment, you’re in control.\\n\\nBut when it feels like you’re not, God is. Just trust that it’s in greater hands.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nWhat do you do when you feel down?\\n\\nYou breathe, acknowledge your feelings,\\n\\nreaffirm, remind yourself that this is just another phase, and that it will pass.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nYou deserve to be loved unapologetically, consistently, without asking for it.\\n\\nDon’t be giving out too much.\\n\\nDon’t hold in too much, either.\\n\\nWhen it’s real, you will know,\\n\\nWithout having to give in more than you should.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nForgive yourself,\\n\\nfor tolerating the unfairness, other people put you through, for not knowing and doing better, for prioritizing everything and everyone else but yourself, for constantly breaking your spirit without realizing it, for not being kind enough toward yourself. If you've given so many chances to those who've wronged you, what could ever make you less deserving?\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat you constantly feed on grows.\\n\\nWhether it’s love or hate, it grows.\\n\\nAnd it’ll reflect through your actions.\\n\\nDon’t feed the energy and habits you’ll struggle to accommodate.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nWe tend to expect from others what we can give, and this makes us vulnerable.\\n\\nIt’s okay to have expectations, not having any would make you settle for whatever is on the table.\\n\\nEven so, learn to deal with unmet expectations without convincing yourself that yours were too high or unrealistic.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nMay every phase of your life, in its own way, be gentle to you.\\n\\nI hope you'll have a tribe of your own that's constantly there to help you see your worth. May you be reminded of the greatness you're destined for.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m sorry,\\n\\nThat when you felt unappreciated, someone invalidated you. When you expressed yourself, you were labelled as “over sensitive”. That you kept meeting people who tried to dim your light.\\n\\nDespite it all, do not let them define you. And remember that no one can dim your light without your approval. Don’t invest yourself in what cannot make you brighter than you already are.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nWhen you’re hurting,\\n\\nAllow it for as long as it needs to. Don’t rush your healing.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nEven in the most challenging circumstances, choose yourself. Don’t be one of the people who’ve hesitated before they chose you.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nIf a relationship feels forced, let it go. If it doesn’t feel mutually beneficial anymore, let it go. For your sanity, learn to make even the most painful decisions.\\n\\nIt’s not worth it to lose yourself for anything or anyone.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nNot everyone you get to love will receive and reciprocate your love. That doesn’t imply that your love is unacceptable or that you’re hard to love. It simply means you’re yet to meet those who deserve it.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nForgive those who never reciprocate your good intentions.\\n\\nMay it all be a reminder to love yourself louder, intentionally, and enough not to allow yourself to be unappreciated.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nIt might not make sense now, but just like everything else, it will end. You either learn to live with it or move past it, but in everything, life gets better, and so do you.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nAnd on days when you can’t show up for yourself?\\n\\nYou breathe.\\n\\nYou let things be. You allow it.\\n\\nYou remind yourself that there were days when you showed up for yourself, but today isn’t one of them, and that’s okay.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nTrue happiness involves contentment with where you are in life. Despite where you want to be or what you’re working toward, treasure even the moments you’d never choose if you had your way.\\n\\nThose moments are part of your journey; they make it what it is. Next time you feel overwhelmed by the process, remind yourself that those moments will someday be just a story that adds weight to your success, and it will inspire you to continue.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nThat unutterable painful past, uncertainties, fears, beautiful memories, they’re all part of your journey.\\n\\nYou cannot select and erase your past; you can only learn and move past it. It doesn’t define anything in your present, nor does it equate to your future, but it is still a part of your life.\\n\\nPlease don’t be embarrassed about it.\\n\\nDon’t regret it. Embrace it.\\n\\nIt makes you who you are.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re not too sensitive,\\n\\nYou’re not weak, you’re not an emotional wreck, \\n\\nIf it hurts you, it hurts you.\\n\\nDon’t invalidate your emotions.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nHave you looked at yourself lately?\\n\\nHow resilient you’ve been.\\n\\nHow beautiful you’ve become.\\n\\nAnd just how gracefully are you progressing?\\n\\nSometimes your path won’t make sense, but I hope to see you flourish either way.\\n\\nThere are many voices you’ll hear along the way; I hope you only listen to the ones that remind you how brilliant you are.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nYou’re going to meet people who won’t understand how delicate you are, people who’ll take your way of expressing disappointment as melodramatic. In all those moments, may you be able to reaffirm that you don’t have to change anything about who you are. You’re perfect the way you are.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\nBlame is a toxic coping mechanism. We tend to feel better about ourselves when we don’t take responsibility. Owning up to the part you play in everything is a strength.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nEvery time you complain about something; You miss out on the opportunity to be grateful for another.\\n\\nWhile gratitude brings peace to the heart,\\n\\nMurmuring takes away a moment of peace you cannot regain.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nThere are more than enough reasons why you have the insecurities that you have, but none is big enough to justify why you cannot make an effort to confront and accept those flaws and start working on them.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nDid you try today?\\n\\nHarder than yesterday?\\n\\nTry again tomorrow.\\n\\nAnd if tomorrow is still the same?\\n\\nTry again the next day.\\n\\nWhat’s important is that you don’t stop trying. You don’t give up.\\n\\nI long to see you on your brighter days.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nI know it’s hard,\\n\\nI know it hurts,\\n\\nIt’s okay to feel like it’s too much, I understand.\\n\\nJust allow it.\\n\\nAllow it to hurt, allow it not to make sense, for as long as it takes.\\n\\nYou’re going to be okay.\\n\\nNot today, and maybe not tomorrow, but eventually, you’ll come out stronger, and things will make sense again.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nI’ve realized the importance of having something to look forward to despite how life is going at this moment.\\n\\nYou need hope, even if it’s just a little hope.\\n\\nHope for certainty or possibility. It’s what carries you through until you receive what you’re truly longing for.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt every moment, how you feel is valid. Don’t resist. Acknowledge and reaffirm. It doesn’t matter how it inconveniences anyone, your feelings are real and deserve to be acknowledged.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat if some of the times you thought someone didn’t do enough for you; was it because you expected from them what you could’ve done for yourself?\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nWe all need spaces to express ourselves as genuinely as we can. To express our sadness, happiness, hopelessness, hope, dreams, aspirations, and anxieties.\\n\\nSuch a space can be created within you. You learn how to allow yourself to be as genuine as you can with yourself, without seeing yourself as weak or faulty.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\nFor different reasons, we are constantly reminded of our flaws, weaknesses, failures, or what we lack the most. Consciously choose to dwell on the reasons why you’re so worthy, brilliant and beautiful. And if you can’t find those reasons, look deeper.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nMaybe there are a thousand other people who can do what you do, but there’s no one else who can do it with your touch, and that’s what makes you one of a kind.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nThe energy you choose to surround yourself with eventually becomes yours. Declutter, set boundaries, and remove yourself from the lives of people whose energies don’t align with yours.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nWhile you’re learning how to love yourself the way you need to be loved, the emotions labeled as “negative “will be harder to deal with. Don’t be hard on yourself on those days.\\n\\nIt’s okay to feel angry, sad, anxious, upset, disappointed, or ashamed. Your emotions don’t define you. They simply mean that you process things your way, which is valid.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nGreed\\n\\nThere’s a danger in not being content or satisfied. Always wanting more, always chasing more, even when you have enough of something, you never see it, because you always want more. It’s not wrong to be ambitious, not to settle for the bare minimum. But there is a fragile line between ambition and greed.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe we struggle to accept some things about ourselves because we’ve labeled them “negative.” We find it hard to embrace how fragile or sensitive we are, or how easily we get attached to things/people because we’ve taught ourselves that it’s a weakness and must hide it.\\n\\nYou are art.\\n\\nThe sooner you show up as that, the more you’ll understand why it was never necessary for you to be ashamed of anything you come with. Remember, everything about art has meaning and purpose.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re where you need to be, at the time you need to be. Don’t ever allow yourself to be under the pressure of someone else’s timeline.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nA place\\n\\nFind a place within yourself, that shares a little kindness when you make mistakes, that meets you with grace when you’re struggling, that allows you to let yourself be loved.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\nThis is for all the stolen years.\\n\\nWhere society’s standards made you believe that there was an acceptable kind of beauty, and yours didn’t meet that criterion.\\n\\nWhen you look in the mirror or take a picture, see beauty in your uniqueness. That way, you take back the power that was once stolen from you.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nMy hope for you is that you never let anyone, and I mean anyone, let you believe that you’re not enough.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nI pray that you get to a point where you only do things because you want to do them. Not because someone approves. When you get to that point, realize how gratifying it is not to depend on anyone else’s validation but yours.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nSome days, loving yourself is being able to breathe, and reminding yourself that you’re doing okay.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’ve given parts of yourself to people, some were good, and some weren’t.\\n\\nI hope that you don’t spend the rest of your life holding yourself because of the people who didn’t appreciate you.\\n\\nOh, beloved, you deserve to meet each and every person who’s going to value you.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nRemember the excitement of getting something right, achieving a goal, making a new friend, starting afresh, celebrating an anniversary or simply feeling happy. But also take note of the times you failed to do something, got hurt, disappointed, lied to, or felt things weren't going your way.\\n\\nThose instances remind us of when we need to be more gentle with ourselves.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nDon't ever associate yourself with small. In whatever you do or want to do, don't indulge in the thought that you're 'small,' because your thoughts are so powerful that they manifest.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nKnow when to give and when to stop giving. Giving is a kind gesture but knowing when to stop is a kinder act toward yourself.\\n\\nBeloved, those who take don't have limits.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nMeet yourself with a little more grace. In how long it takes you to heal, love yourself better, or build something you want. Most of the time, you're not failing how to do things; you're just not gracious enough toward yourself.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nYou're where you need to be, at the time you need to be. Don't ever allow yourself to be under pressure of someone else's timeframe.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nYou don’t need to have it all figured out. Just give it your best shot, and let things unfold on their own.\\n\\nDO NOT GIVEUP & READ GOOD --> OBSERVE BETTER\\n\\nComparing yourself to others is normal.\\n\\nDon’t beat yourself up about it.
